# fastfoto
Code to support the processing of photos scanned by the Epson FastFoto series of scanners 

I only own a FF-680W, so I can only confirm that these scripts work with the
file names generated by that model, but users of the 640W can let me know if
there are no issues using these on their model too.

Similarly, I've only run these scripts on my Mac, so I can't vouch for their
appropriateness on Windows or Linux.

The script concat-backs.sh assumes the presence of ImageMagick. I installed that
and its dependency ghostscript using `brew install`.
